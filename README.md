# Developing
## Notes
The project uses [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) which uses Webpack4, so it requires Node.js 14 LTS (as explained [here](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation) ).
If you use a self-signed certificate for the open-balena server, you need to allow it for your browser or system wide.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```
